# My Energy Graph

This outlines my general energy levels throughout the day:

*   **Fajr Prayer to 10-11 AM:** Highest amount of energy. Ideal for complex and demanding tasks.
*   **10-11 AM to Dhuhr (approx. 1 PM):** Small breakfast/coffee, then highest energy until lunch.
*   **Dhuhr (approx. 1 PM) onwards:** After lunch and a nap, a "second round" of work with renewed energy, akin to a second day. This high energy level lasts until Asr.
*   **After Asr:** A small energy boost with a final lunch/snack. This energy is moderate.
*   **After Maghrib:** One extra, but very low, belt of energy suitable for very small tasks.
*   **After Isha:** Brain is "cooked," no longer functioning for work.
